            <h3>Emma Thompson - National Swimming Champion</h3>
            <p>"When I joined Brunel, I was a good swimmer but lacked the technical refinement needed to compete at the highest level. The coaching I received at the Brunel Sports Centre transformed my technique and approach to training. The flexible scheduling allowed me to balance my academic studies with my athletic pursuits, and the state-of-the-art facilities gave me everything I needed to excel. I'm proud to say that I've now represented both Brunel and my country in international competitions."</p>

        <div class="testimonial">
            <h3>James Chen - University Basketball Captain</h3>
            <p>"The basketball program at Brunel completely changed my university experience. Coming from a school where basketball wasn't a major sport, I found a community of players and coaches who were passionate about developing my skills. The regular practice sessions, competitive matches, and fitness support have helped me become a more complete player. Being selected as team captain in my final year has been the highlight of my time at Brunel."</p>

            <h3>Aisha Patel - Athletics Scholarship Recipient</h3>
            <p>"The athletics program at Brunel provided me with the perfect environment to develop as both a student and an athlete. The coaching staff understood the challenges of balancing academic demands with athletic training, and they created personalized programs that allowed me to excel in both areas. The indoor and outdoor facilities meant that I could train year-round, regardless of the weather. Thanks to the support I received, I secured a sports scholarship that has helped fund my education."</p>
